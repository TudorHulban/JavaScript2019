The folder contains a skeleton for a web component.
The XXX string would need to be replaced with the name of the web component.
The web component could be used as per the below.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>XXX</title>
</head>

<body>
    <link rel="import" href="./CoXXX/CoXXX.html">

    <compo-xxx></compo-xxx>
</body>

</html>
```
